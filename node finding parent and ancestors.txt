loop through each child, if the child is not what we are looking for
then we look through the child's children until we find the node we
are looking for. When found, we return the node.

Only checking for children with folder as types.

If an element has a child that we already know of (e.g. file 1)
Then we return that element (node)

Pass an original node (file) that we will compare with the others for
finding the folder.

Working for 1 level
Now we check if the node is a folder then do the loop again.

first loop as for loop to get the first level folders.

if first folders have childCount > 0 -> call loopOver functio
function loopOverChildren(children)
inside it if at any point it encounters the file being looked for
then it will break.

Successfully returning the file selected
Now we need to track the latest parent

line 563 used to return fold. Now just a simple return;

Removing folders recursively removing everything in that folder.
Recursive function which once it finds it, stops the function.
